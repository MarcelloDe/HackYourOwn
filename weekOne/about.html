	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>After completing my degree in Human Rights and Equity Studies along with a Certificate in Human Resources Management from York University in Toronto,
		Ontario Canada, I dabbled in some new job ventures and decided to to delve into Data Science. I was lucky to take part in a 12-Week Coding Bootcamp
		where I learned the basics of web-development which then launched my interest in Coding. At the time Coronavirus hit in March of 2020 I
		 had just finished a continuing education Certificate in Data Science from Sheridan College. Faced with little job prospects because of the qurantine and 
		 lockdowns I began learning to code with Hack Your Own to improve my skills and knowlege.
